Protcheck 1.0.0 - @lockedbyte (https://github.com/lockedbyte/protcheck)

A C utility to check an ELF binary protections parsing the ELF directly instead of using intermediate programs like readelf or grep.

This tool checks for:
    - FORTIFY Source
    - NX
    - PIE
    - Canary
    - RELRO
    - Interesting imports like system or execve
    - Dangerous functions like gets()


Advantages of using C-based program instead of bash/python ones:
    - You do not depend on external programs like readelf or grep.
    - Avoid problems: If the program you are using changes it's output, or a user has a different language the results could get wrong.
    - Parsing the ELF file to check for those protections directly in C could let you understand how to find them manually and how the ELF works internally.
    - In some CTFs you need to use remote systems that do not have some programs like readelf or grep, using a non-dependant binary could help you to check the protections for the needed binaries
